    <h1> SUGAR</h1>
    <h2> Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. Simple sugars, also
    called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double
    sugars, are molecules made of two bonded monosaccharides; common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose
    (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose). White sugar is a refined form of sucrose. In the body,
    compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars.
    
    Longer chains of monosaccharides (>2) are not regarded as sugars and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides.
    Starch is a glucose polymer found in plants, the most abundant source of energy in human food. Some other chemical
    substances, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste but are not classified as
    sugar.
    
    Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants. Honey and fruits are abundant natural sources of simple sugars. Sucrose
    is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make
    refined sugar. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes. Maltose may be
    produced by malting grain. Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. It can only be found in milk,
    including human breast milk, and in some dairy products. A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup, industrially produced by
    converting corn starch into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.
    
    Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g., cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available
    ultra-processed food and beverages, and is sometimes used as a sweetener for foods (e.g., toast and cereal) and
    beverages (e.g., coffee and tea). The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 pounds) of sugar each year. North
    and South Americans consume up to 50 kg (110 lb), and Africans consume under 20 kg (44 lb).[1]
    
    As free sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high
    in free sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health. In 2015, the World Health Organization strongly
    recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total energy intake
    and encouraged a reduction to below 5%.[2] In general, high sugar consumption damages human health more than it provides
    nutritional benefit and is associated with a risk of cardiometabolic and other health detriments.</h2>
